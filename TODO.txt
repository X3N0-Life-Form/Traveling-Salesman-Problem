Big TODO list:
    -fixor leaks
    -efficiency tracking:
        analyse results more
        make proba adjustments non-linear
        compile results and use that to establish probabilities
            con: requires solving a problem first
            maybe compile results based on things like size?
        probability evolution: try toying with the probabilities of intervals
            that aren't being chosen when updating?
    -write report
