Big TODO list:
    -fixor leaks
    -efficiency tracking:
        make proba adjustments non-linear
        probability evolution: try toying with the probabilities of intervals
            that aren't being chosen when updating?
        add probability for moving on before going through every pair
        try to use different relations/strategies at runtime
            make new runner subclass?
    -intervals: save cost diffs + use that to alter probability
    -write report
    -see about reducing the number of pair copies
    -change some of the cmd line defaults to prune the line a bit
