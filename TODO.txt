Big TODO list:
    -implement multithreading in Runner
    -fix the screwed up tests:
        for the record:
            bestFit
            worstFit
            runner
        ideas: investigate reused paths in tests
    -do refactoring operations to eliminate duplicated code in Swap, Insert &
    distance calculations
    -investigate what sometimes causes best/worst fit to produce a bad neighbor
    -refactoring: new constructor format (see Strategy constructors)
    -add insert to main & launch script
