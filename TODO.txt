Big TODO list:
    -implement multithreading in Runner
    -fix the screwed up tests:
        for the record:
            bestFit
            worstFit
            runner
        ideas: investigate reused paths in tests
    -investigate what sometimes causes best/worst fit to produce a bad neighbor
    -get the regex-based parsing working
    -allow limitless depth
    -to investigate: insert/firstFit stopping at depth = 0
    -give completion% when running big things
    -add runtime stop condition
    -to optimize:
        Problem.getDistance()
        reduce redundant calls to Problem.getDimension()
        see what we can do about the pair vector's random shuffle
